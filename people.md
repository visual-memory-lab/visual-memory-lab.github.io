My overall research focus is the cognitive neuroscience of (mostly visual) working memory, and what its neural representation can tell us about goal-directed behavior. How is memory used in the service of pursuing new goals? How may the current goal shape how memories are represented? These questions relate to our understanding of the neural basis of working memory and how it underpins decision-making. I use invasive and non-invasive electrophysiological measures of neural activity to assess the context-dependence of working memory representations. My current research consists mainly of two larger topics: 1) The role of different representational formats of working memory in sequential, extended behaviours. 2) Task-dependent and task-independent forms of working memory maintenance during learning. In general, I am interested in how the adaptability of memory representation to current task demands allows humans to be flexible, efficient problem solvers. 


# Ph.D. Students

## Mariana Lomelí

I obtained my B.Sc. in Psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Then, my interest in human cognition and temporal dynamics of neural activity led me to join  Dr. Rodolfo Solis Vivanco’s Cognitive Neurophisiology lab at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (Mexico). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD jointly in the Visual Memory Lab run by Dr Nicholas Myers and the Helfrich Lab run by Dr Dr Randolph Helfrich. The main goal of my research is to understand the neurological underpinnings of memories’ context-dependent flexibility, as well as to develop novel analytical approaches to maximize the readout of mnemonic content from non-invasive and intracranial human brain recordings. 

## Juan M. Chau

I obtained a B.Sc. in Mechatronics at the National University of Engineering, in Peru (2013) and a M.Sc. in Mechatronics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (2018), where I currently work remotely as a Lecturer for Computer Science, Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering courses. My prior research experience includes Brain-Computer Interfaces and Sports Biomechanics. I am currently a Psychology Ph.D. Student at the University of Nottingham, where I research about working memory information removal mechanisms and other topics related to working memory, long-term memory and learning under the supervision of Professors Nicholas Myers and Matias Ison.

## Uma Ajmeria

I obtained a BSc in Neuroscience at the University of Central Lancashire and worked in a variety of RA roles including drosophila fly dissections, and infant language development projects. However, memory has always been my passion and so I am currently studying as a second year PhD student under Dr. Nicholas Myers focusing on the world of working memory. Our main projects highlight the categorisation process of visual stimuli, analysing local field potential data, as well as exploring interference within WM.


# Masters Students

## Francesco D'Antonio

MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience 

Current project: Analysing serial dependent biases in working memory through EEG decoding. 

My background is in physics, I completed an MPhys from the University of Oxford, focusing on creating a computational model of topological insulators. Following this I completed the Teach First leadership development programme, teaching maths for two years in the north east of England. I am passionate about understanding working memory, with my research hopefully having an impact on the way students are educated.

## Sarah Ottahal

MSc in Psychology Research Methods 

My name is Sarah Ottahal, and I am currently studying for a Masters of Science in Psychology Research Methods at the University of Nottingham. Previously, I completed a BSc in Psychology from Nottingham Trent University, and worked at a charity for people with learning disabilities and brain damage. This sparked my interest in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous research and current research interests include face-perception and visual attention in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, atypical face processing in adults with autism spectrum disorder, as well as ageing with neurodevelopmental disorders.
